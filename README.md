# -Sequential-Decision-Making-in-Pendulum-Dynamics-with-LQR-Control
Developed and implemented the equations of motion (EOM) for a pendulum, modeling its behavior in discrete time. Simulated the pendulum dynamics with different initial conditions and control strategies, including open-loop control (u[t] = 0) and optimal state-feedback control (ulqr[t] = K[t]x[t]) using Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Utilized a state-space representation, including the state transition matrix (AD) and the control matrix (B), to model the pendulum's behavior. Explored the impact of different control parameters, including the control gain matrix K and the cost function weights (Q and R), on the pendulum's motion. Visualized the value function (V(x) = x'P0x) on a 2D plot to gain insights into the system's behavior.
